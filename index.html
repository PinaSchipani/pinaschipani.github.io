                <p>In the beginning of 2000, fashion lovers opened their blogs to share their ideas and comment on the
                    latest trends. Shortly after, bloggers learned to monetize their contents and fashion blogs evolved
                    from
                    personal diaries into smarketing tools.</p>
                Social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Youtube spread. They enabled bloggers to
                reach a greater audience and have an even closer relationship with their existing readership. Many
                bloggers decided to close their websites to focus on producing content for socials, particularly for
                Instagram.
                <p>Nowadays, influencers have become prominent members of the fashion world. They collaborate with brand
                    names which are increasingly keen to invest their money in tailored social campaigns rather than
                    buying
                    magazine advertising. But how do advertisers deicide where to put their money?</p>
                <p>
                    The marketing and data analytics platform Launchmetrics - trusted by many worldwide-famous brands
                    such
                    as Adidas, Fendi and Louis Vuitton - developed an algorithm able to cross-compare the performance of
                    the
                    “voices” that act in the fields of Fashion, Luxury and Cosmetics.
                </p>
                <p>The MIV (Media Impact Value) algorithm</p>

                <p>“measures the impact of relevant media placements on all channels (online, social, prit) in order to
                    derive a quantitative number for performance outcomes. The algorithm has been finely tuned to to
                    specificities of the Fashion, Luxury and Cosmetics (FLC) industries, relying on historical data to
                    create a more accurate way of measurement. It also takes into account both media and content quality
                    to
                    provide a higher value for content posted by more influential Voices or content that includes
                    powerful
                    images or videos. “</p>


                <p> The algorithm calculate the impact of five main “voices”:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Celebrities</li>
                        <li>Partners</li>
                        <li>Owned media</li>
                        <li>Media</li>
                        <li>Influencers</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>According to the company “the voice-centric approach places an emphasis on the voices speaking in
                        order
                        to cross-compare performance.” The selection of voices reflects the real investments and
                        organizational
                        decisions that surround marketing and communications strategies, and allows brands to craft the
                        perfect
                        “voice mix” across various channels, media types and regions.</p>
                    <p>Using this method of evaluation, Launchmetrics conducted an analysis of the voices dominating the
                        top 4 International Fashion Weeks of the Spring/Summer 2019 Season: Milano, Paris, London and
                        New York.</p>
