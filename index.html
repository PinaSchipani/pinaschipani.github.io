                <p> At the beginning of the 2000s, fashion lovers opened their blogs to share their ideas and comment on
                    the
                    latest trends. Shortly after, bloggers learned to monetize their contents and fashion blogs evolved
                    from
                    personal diaries into marketing tools.</p>
                <p>Social media platforms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"
                        target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"
                        target="_blank">Twitter</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/" target=" _blank"> Facebook </a>, and <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"> Youtube</a> spread. They
                    enabled bloggers
                    to
                    reach a greater audience and have an even closer relationship with their existing readership. Many
                    bloggers decided to close their websites to focus on producing content for socials, particularly for
                    Instagram.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, influencers have become prominent members of the fashion world. They collaborate with brand
                    names which are increasingly keen to invest their money in social media advertising rather than in
                    the magazine's one. </p>

                <p>But how do advertisers deicide where to put their money?</p>
                <p>
                    The marketing and data analytics platform <a href="https://www.launchmetrics.com/" target="_blank">
                        Launchmetrics </a> - trusted by many worldwide-famous brands
                    such
                    as Adidas, Fendi and Louis Vuitton - developed an algorithm able to cross-compare the performance of
                    the
                    “voices” that act in the fields of Fashion, Luxury and Cosmetics.
                </p>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.launchmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MIV-explained.pdf"
                        target="_blank">
                        MIV (Media Impact Value) algorithm: </a> </p>

                <p>“measures the impact of relevant media placements on all channels (online, social, prit) in order to
                    derive a quantitative number for performance outcomes. The algorithm has been finely tuned to to
                    specificities of the Fashion, Luxury and Cosmetics (FLC) industries, relying on historical data to
                    create a more accurate way of measurement. It also takes into account both media and content quality
                    to
                    provide a higher value for content posted by more influential Voices or content that includes
                    powerful
                    images or videos. “</p>


                <p> The algorithm calculate the impact of five main “voices”:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Celebrities</li>
                        <li>Partners</li>
                        <li>Owned media</li>
                        <li>Media</li>
                        <li>Influencers</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p> <a href="https://www.launchmetrics.com/" target="_blank"> According to the company </a> “the
                        voice-centric" approach places an emphasis on the voices speaking in
                        order
                        to cross-compare performance.” The selection of voices reflects the real investments and
                        organizational
                        decisions that surround marketing and communications strategies, and allows brands to craft the
                        perfect
                        “voice mix” across various channels, media types and regions.</p>
                    <p>Using this method of evaluation, Launchmetrics conducted an analysis of the voices dominating the
                        top 4 International Fashion Weeks of the Spring/Summer 2019 Season: Milano, Paris, London and
                        New York.</p>
                    <p>The study shows that the battle between traditional media and influencers is quite evident. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="full-screen">
            <div class="chart" data-aos="fade-right">
                <div id="chart1"></div>
                <p>Traditional media produced the highest number of mentions (52.4%).</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="full-screen">
            <div class="chart" data-aos="fade-left">
                <div id="chart2"></div>
                <p>However, it was the influencers who managed to garner the most MIV.
                    Opinion leaders gained 49% of the total MIV, meanwhile traditional media’s share of
                    value
                    represents 32%.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="full-screen">
            <div class="chart double" data-aos="fade-left">
                <div id="chart3"></div>
                <div id="chart4"></div>
            </div>
            <p style="text-align: center"> Looking at the Voice analysis of the four fashion weeks, we can see that
                Paris and
                London continue
                seeing effective results from more traditional formats like the media.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="full-screen">
            <div class="chart double" data-aos="fade-right">
                <div id="chart5"></div>
                <div id="chart6"></div>
            </div>
            <p> New York and Milan however, obtaine higher MIV from digital. Milan, in
                particular, seems to be the
                leading market in Europe for influencers </p>
